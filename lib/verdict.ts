   Trialign — the verdict meaning system (single source of truth)

   The verdict triad (meets/clear/confirm/fails) and the fail-closed derivation
   of a trial's overall status are the product's trust surface. They must read
   identically everywhere they are applied:
     - /api/match      : first-pass reasoning over each trial
     - /api/reconfirm  : re-judging a criterion after the patient adds info
     - the client      : recomputing a card's status when a "confirm" resolves

   So the rules text and the derivation live here, imported by all three, rather
   than being re-stated (and allowed to drift) in each place.

/** The verdict rules — the exact meaning of each verdict. Shared by every
 *  prompt that judges a criterion so the meaning system never forks. */
export const VERDICT_RULES = `Verdict rules (this is the product's meaning system — be exact):
- meets  : an INCLUSION criterion the patient satisfies. Cite the evidence.
- clear  : an EXCLUSION criterion that is NOT triggered (good for the patient).
- confirm: the record genuinely lacks the data to judge this criterion. Say so — never guess it into a pass or a fail. This becomes a coordinator to-do (e.g. "confirm RECIST measurability", "confirm HbA1c").
- fails  : an INCLUSION criterion the patient does not meet, OR an EXCLUSION criterion that IS triggered.

For EVERY criterion also set \`remediable\` — whether this patient could come to satisfy it. It is only consulted when the verdict is "fails"; set it honestly regardless (use false for anything that is already satisfied and fixed):
- true  : a washout that will elapse, a scan or lab that can be ordered or redrawn, a consent or device that can be obtained, a value that fluctuates and may re-qualify. These are the near-misses a coordinator can actually work.
- false : fixed for this patient — sex, age band, tumor type or subtype, an irreversible prior therapy or surgery, a permanent comorbidity, a prior-lines cap already exceeded.
Judge the CRITERION, not your optimism. If becoming eligible would require the disease itself to change, it is false.

Hard requirements:
- Fail closed. If the patient is a near-miss, list EVERY failing criterion, not just the first. A false "so close" is worse than a clean no.
- Cite the record in the coordinator's words in the evidence field. Be concrete.
- Do not invent patient data. If the profile is silent on something a criterion needs, that criterion is "confirm", not a pass.
- Keep requirements atomic and in plain clinical language.`;

/* ---- ranking ---------------------------------------------------------------
   The old ordering was `metCount / total`. That ratio is not comparable across
   trials: the criteria are segmented by the model, so one study yields 8 atomic
   requirements and another yields 25 from prose of the same substance. A study
   that happened to be split finely ranked below one split coarsely, purely as an
   artifact of segmentation — a scoring bug wearing the costume of a score.

   The replacement sorts on quantities that mean the same thing everywhere:

     1. status         — eligible, then uncertain, then near, then the rest.
     2. hard failures  — within "near", definitively-out sinks below workable.
     3. open items     — the coordinator's actual workload, an absolute count.
     4. remediable     — fewer things to chase first.
     5. stale record   — a registry entry untouched for months ranks last.

   Every term is either a code-derived count or a registry date. None of it is a
   model's self-reported confidence.

/* ---- cohort ranking (§C1) ---------------------------------------------------
   /api/screen holds the trial fixed and ranks PATIENTS against it — the mirror

   discipline, same reason: absolute, code-derived counts only, never a
   met/total ratio (identical argument as above — a patient whose ledger
   happened to segment into more atomic criteria is not thereby a worse fit).

   Order is what a coordinator actually triages on: who's in, then who has the
   fewest open items to chase, then who has the fewest settled failures — a
   coordinator can still work a patient with one open "confirm" faster than one
   buried in hard fails, even though both are merely "uncertain"/"near". */
